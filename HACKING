Things are obviously in a tremendous state of flux.  There are
numerous pieces of code that are undergoing large amounts of changes,
and I periodically commit upwards of 20 files at a time with super
helpful commit messages like "sync".  Even with this current state of
affairs, I'd like people looking at the code, and if they feel moved
to contribute, so much the better.

Please contact me if you're interested in working in a specific area
so we can try to avoid stepping on each others' toes.

There are a couple of large, well contained tasks that could be done
largely independently of everything else.  I'll get to them
eventually, but they're all free for the taking.  I've ordered them in
terms of size/difficulty/coolness, from hardest to easiest (and
therefore coolest to least cool):

	1. Figure out font rendering so that we can operate with either SC
	   or BW assets.  the best solution would enable us to render
	   fonts from the data contained in the
	   Stardat.mpq/Broodat.mpq archives, but I'd settle for a
	   solution that works with either CD's install.exe.

	2. The parallax (SPK) renderer used for the starfield
	   background on platform levels renders a 2x2 white rectangle
	   for each star.  apparently the .spk file contains bitmap
	   data for the stars.  Figure out the format and render the
	   stars correctly.

Email me if you're interested in any of the above tasks, and I'll get
some more info to you regarding where in the code changes will be
likely, and answer any other questions you might have.

welcome,
toshok
